<h2><b>History of the Comstock Patent Medicine Business and of
Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills</b></h2>
<p>For nearly a century a conspicuous feature of the small
riverside village of Morristown, in northern New York State, was
the W.H. Comstock factory, better known as the home of the
celebrated Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills. This business never
grew to be more than a modest undertaking in modern industrial
terms, and amid the congestion of any large city its few
buildings straddling a branch railroad and its work force of
several dozens at most would have been little noticed, but in its
rural setting the enterprise occupied a prominent role in the
economic life of the community for over ninety years. Aside from
the omnipresent forest and dairy industries, it represented the
only manufacturing activity for miles around and was easily the
largest single employer in its village, as well as the chief
recipient and shipper of freight at the adjacent railroad
station. For some years, early in the present century, the
company supplied a primitive electric service to the community,
and the Comstock Hotel, until it was destroyed by fire, served as
the principal village hostelry.<br>
<br>
 But the influence of this business was by no means strictly
local. For decades thousands of boxes of pills and bottles of
elixir, together with advertising circulars and almanacs in the
millions, flowed out of this remote village to druggists in
thousands of communities in the United States and Canada, in
Latin America, and in the Orient. And Dr. Morse's Indian Root
Pills and the other remedies must have been household names
wherever people suffered aches and infirmities. Thus Morristown,
notwithstanding its placid appearance, played an active role in
commerce and industry throughout the colorful patent-medicine
era.<br>
<br>
 Today, the Indian Root Pill factory stands abandoned and
forlorn&mdash;its decline and demise brought on by an age of more
precise medical diagnoses and the more stringent enforcement of
various food and drug acts. After abandonment, the factory was
ransacked by vandals; and records, documents, wrappers,
advertising circulars, pills awaiting packaging, and other
effects were thrown down from the shelves and scattered over the
floors. This made it impossible to recover and examine the
records systematically. The former proprietors of the business,
however, had for some reason&mdash;perhaps sheer
inertia&mdash;apparently preserved all of their records for over
a century, storing them in the loft-like attic over the packaging
building. Despite their careless treatment, enough records were
recovered to reconstruct most of the history of the Comstock
enterprise and to cast new light upon the patent-medicine
industry of the United States during its heyday.<br>
<br>
 The Comstock business, of course, was far from unique. Hundreds
of manufacturers of proprietary remedies flourished during the
1880s and 1890s the Druggists' Directory for 1895 lists
approximately 1,500. The great majority of these factories were
much smaller than Comstock; one suspects, in fact, that most of
them were no more than backroom enterprises conducted by
untrained, but ambitious, druggists who, with parttime help,
mixed up some mysterious concoctions and contrived imaginative
advertising schemes. A few of these businesses were considerably
larger than Comstock.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h4><b>The Origin of the Business</b></h4>
<p>The Indian Root Pill business was carried on during most of
its existence by two members of the Comstock family&mdash;father
and son&mdash;and because of unusual longevity, this control by
two generations extended for over a century. The plant was also
located in Morristown for approximately ninety years. The Indian
Root Pills, however, were not actually originated by the Comstock
family, nor were they discovered in Morristown. Rather, the
business had its genesis in New York City, at a time when the
city still consisted primarily of two-or three-story buildings
and did not extend beyond the present 42nd Street.<br>
<br>
 According to an affidavit written in 1851&mdash;and much of the
history of the business is derived from documents prepared in
connection with numerous lawsuits&mdash;the founder of the
Comstock drug venture was Edwin Comstock, sometime in or before
1833. Edwin, along with the numerous other brothers who will
shortly enter the picture, was a son of Samuel Comstock, of
Butternuts, Otsego County, New York. Samuel, a fifth-generation
descendant of William Comstock, one of the pioneer settlers of
New London, Connecticut, and ancestor of most of the Comstocks in
America, was born in East Lyme, Connecticut, a few years before
the Revolution, but sometime after the birth of Edwin in 1794 he
moved to Otsego County, New York.<br>
<br>
 Edwin, in 1828, moved to Batavia, New York, where his son,
William Henry Comstock, was born on August 1, 1830. Within four
or five years, however, Edwin repaired to New York City, where he
established the extensive drug and medicine business that was to
be carried on by members of his family for over a century. Just
why Edwin performed this brief sojourn in Batavia, or where he
made his initial entry into the drug trade, is not clear,
although the rapid growth of his firm in New York City suggests
that he had had previous experience in that field. It is a
plausible surmise that he may have worked in Batavia in the drug
store of Dr. Levant B. Cotes, which was destroyed in the
village-wide fire of April 19, 1833; the termination of Edwin's
career in Batavia might have been associated either with that
disaster or with the death of his wife in 1831.<br>
<br>
 The Comstocks also obviously had some medical tradition in their
family. Samuel's younger brother, John Lee Comstock, was trained
as a physician and served in that capacity during the War of
1812&mdash;although he was to gain greater prominence as a
historian and natural philosopher. All five of Samuel's sons
participated at least briefly in the drug trade, while two of
them also had careers as medical doctors. A cousin of Edwin,
Thomas Griswold Comstock (born 1829), also became a prominent
homeopathic physician and gynecologist in St. Louis.<sup><a href=
"#1">[1]</a></sup> It might also be significant that the original
home of the Comstock family, in Connecticut, was within a few
miles of the scene of the discovery of the first patent medicine
in America&mdash;Lee's "Bilious Pills"&mdash;by Dr. Samuel Lee
(1744-1805), of Windham, sometime prior to 1796.<sup><a href=
"#2">[2]</a></sup> This medicine enjoyed such a rapid success
that it was soon being widely imitated, and the Comstocks could
not have been unaware of its popularity.<br>
<br>
 So it seems almost certain that Edwin was no longer a novice
when he established his own drug business in New York City.
Between 1833 and 1837 he employed his brother, Lucius S. Comstock
(born in 1806), as a clerk, and for the next fifteen years Lucius
will figure very conspicuously in this story. He not merely
appended the designation "M.D." to his name and claimed
membership in the Medical Society of the City of New York, but
also described himself as a Counsellor-at-Law.<br>
<br>
 Edwin, the founder of the business, did not live long to enjoy
its prosperity&mdash;or perhaps we should say that he was
fortunate enough to pass away before it experienced its most
severe vicissitudes and trials. After Edwin's death in 1837,
Lucius continued the business in partnership with another
brother, Albert Lee, under the style of Comstock &amp; Co. Two
more brothers, John Carlton (born 1819) and George Wells (born
1820), were employed as clerks.</p>

</table>
<p>The partnership of Comstock &amp; Co. between Lucius and
Albert was terminated by a dispute between the two brothers in
1841, and Albert went his own way, taking up a career as a
physician and living until 1876. Lucius next went into business
with his mother-in-law, Anne Moore, from 1841 to 1846; after the
dissolution of this firm, he formed a new partnership, also under
the name of Comstock &amp; Co., with his brother John (generally
known as J. Carlton). This firm again employed as clerks George
Wells Comstock and a nephew, William Henry, a son of Edwin.
William Henry was to eventually become the founder of the
business at Morristown.<br>
<br>
In March of 1849, still a new partnership was formed, comprising
Lucius, J. Carlton, and George Wells, under the name of Comstock
&amp; Co. Brothers, although the existing partnership of Comstock
&amp; Co. was not formally terminated. Assets, inventories, and
receivables in the process of collection were assigned by
Comstock &amp; Co. to Comstock &amp; Co. Brothers. But before the
end of 1849 the partners quarreled, Lucius fell out with his
brothers, and after a period of dissension, the firm of Comstock
&amp; Co. Brothers was dissolved as of August 1, 1850. On or
about the same date J. Carlton and George Wells formed a new
partnership, under the name of Comstock &amp; Brother, doing
business at 9 John Street in New York City, also taking their
nephew, William Henry, as a clerk. Lucius continued in business
at the old address of 57 John Street. As early as June 30, 1851,
the new firm of Comstock &amp; Brother registered the following
trade names<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> with the Smithsonian Institution:
Carlton's Liniment, a certain remedy for the Piles; Carlton's
Celebrated Nerve and Bone Liniment for Horses; Carlton's
Condition Powder for Horses and Cattle; Judson's Chemical Extract
of Cherry and Lungwort.<br>
<br>
The repetition of his name suggests that J. Carlton was the
principal inventor of his firm's remedies.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Suits and Countersuits</h2>
<p>All of the foregoing changes in name and business organization
must have been highly confusing to the wide array of agents and
retail druggists over many states and the provinces of Canada
with whom these several firms had been doing business. And when
George Wells and J. Carlton split off from Lucius and established
their own office down the street, it was not at all clear who
really represented the original Comstock business, who had a
right to collect the numerous accounts and notes still
outstanding, and who owned the existing trade names and formulas.
Dispute was inevitable under such circumstances, and it was
aggravated by Lucius' irascible temper. Unfortunately for family
harmony, these business difficulties also coincided with
differences among the brothers over their father's will. Samuel
had died in 1840, but his will was not probated until 1846; for
some reason Lucius contested its terms. There had also been
litigation over the estate of Edwin, the elder brother.<br>
<br>
With the inability of the two parties to reach friendly
agreement, a lawsuit was initiated in June 1850 between Lucius on
the one hand and J. Carlton and George Wells on the other for the
apportionment of the property of Comstock &amp; Co. Brothers,
which was valued at about $25,000 or $30,000. Subsequently, while
this litigation was dragging on, Lucius found a more satisfying
opportunity to press his quarrel against his brothers. This arose
out of his belief that they were taking his mail out of the post
office.<br>
<br>
On May 26, 1851, one of the New York newspapers, the <i>Day
Book</i>, carried the following item:</p>
<blockquote>United States Marshal's Office&mdash;Complaint was
made against J. Carlton Comstock and Geo. Wells Comstock, of No.
9 John Street, and a clerk in their employ, for taking letters
from the Post Office, belonging to Dr. L.S. Comstock, of 57 in
the same street.<br>
<br>
Dr. Comstock having missed a large number of letters, on inquiry
at the Post Office it was suspected that they had been taken to
No. 9 John Street.<br>
<br>
By an arrangement with the Postmaster and his assistants, several
letters were then put in the Post Office, containing orders
addressed to Dr. Comstock, at 57 John Street, for goods to be
sent to various places in the city to be forwarded to the
country. The letters were taken by the accused or their clerk,
opened at No. 9, the money taken out and the articles sent as
directed, accompanied by bills in the handwriting of Geo. Wells
Comstock. Warrants were then issued by the U.S. Commissioner and
Recorder Talmadge, and two of the accused found at home were
arrested and a large number of letters belonging to Dr. C. found
on the premises. J.C. Comstock has not yet been arrested. It is
said he is out of the city.<br>
<br>
These two young men have for some months been trading sometimes
under the name of "Comstock &amp; Brother", and sometimes as
"Judson &amp; Co." at No. 9 John Street.</blockquote>
<p>The same episode was also mentioned in the <i>Express</i>, the
<i>Commercial Advertiser</i>, and the <i>Tribune</i>. In fact, a
spirited debate in the "affair of the letters" was carried on in
the pages of the press for a week. The brothers defended
themselves in the following notice printed in the <i>Morning
Express</i> for May 31:</p>
<blockquote>OBTAINING LETTERS<br>
<br>
Painful as it is, we are again compelled to appear before the
public in defense of our character as citizens and business men.
The two letters referred to by L.S. Comstock (one of which
contained One Dollar only) <i>were both directed "Comstock
&amp;Co." which letters we claim; and we repeat what we have
before said, and what we shall prove that no letter or letters
from any source directed to L.S. Comstock or Lucius S. Comstock
have been taken or obtained by either of us or any one in our
employ</i>.<br>
<br>
The public can judge whether a sense of "duty to the Post Office
Department and the community", induced our brother to make this
charge against us (which if proved would consign us to the
Penitentiary) and under the pretence of searching for letters,
which perhaps never existed; to send Police Officers to invade
not only our store, but our dwelling house, where not even the
presence of our aged Mother could protect from intrusion. These
are the means by which he has put himself</blockquote>

<p>Lucius, for his part, never deigned to recognize his opponents
as brothers but merely described them as "two young men who claim
relationship to me."<br>
<br>
It was the position of J. Carlton and George that as they,
equally with Lucius, were heirs of the dissolved firm of Comstock
&amp; Co. Brothers, they had as much right as Lucius to receive
and open letters so addressed. Moreover, since the predecessor
firm of Comstock &amp; Co. had never been dissolved, J. Carlton
also shared in any rights, claims, or property of this firm. In a
more personal vein, the brothers also asserted in their brief
that Lucius "is not on speaking terms with his aged mother nor
any one of his brothers or sisters, Nephews or Nieces, or even of
his Uncles or Aunts, embracing quite a large circle all of whom
have been estranged from him, either by personal difficulties
with him, or his improper conduct towards his brothers." Lucius,
in turn, had copies of his charges against his brothers, together
with aspersions against their character and their medicines,
printed as circulars and widely distributed to all present or
former customers in the United States and Canada.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the civil litigation respecting the division of the
assets of the old partnership, broken down into a welter of
complaints and countercomplaints, dragged on until 1852. No
document reporting the precise terms of the final settlement was
discovered, although the affair was obviously compromised on some
basis, as the surviving records do speak of a division of the
stock in New York City and at St. Louis. The original premises at
57 John Street were left in the possession of Lucius. In this
extensive litigation, J. Carlton and George were represented by
the law firm of Allen, Hudson &amp; Campbell, whose bill for
$2,132 they refused to pay in full, so that they were, in turn,
sued by the Allen firm. Some of the lengthy evidence presented in
this collection suit enlightened further the previous contest
with Lucius. He was described as an extremely difficult person:
"at one time the parties came to blows&mdash;and G.W. gave the
Dr. a black eye." The action by the law firm to recover its fee
was finally compromised by the payment of $1,200 in January
1854.<br>
<br>
The settlement of the affairs of Comstock &amp; Co. Brothers
failed to bring peace between Lucius and the others. The rival
successor firms continued to bicker over sales territory and
carried the battle out into the countryside, each contending for
the loyalty of former customers. Letters and circulars attacking
their opponents were widely distributed by both parties. As late
as December 1855, more than four years after the event, Lucius
was still complaining, in a series of printed circulars, about
the "robbery" of his mail from the post office, although the case
had been dismissed by the court.<br>
<br>
But somehow the new firm of Comstock &amp; Brother triumphed over
Comstock &amp; Co., for in the summer of 1853 Lucius found it
necessary to make an assignment of all of his assets to his
creditors. Thereafter he removed his business from John Street to
45 Vesey Street, in the rear of St. Paul's Churchyard, but
although he put out impressive new handbills describing his firm
as "Wholesale Chemists, Druggists and Perfumers," he apparently
no longer prospered in the drug trade, for old New York City
directories show that he shortly turned his main energies to the
practice of law. Versatile as he was, Lucius entered the Union
Army as a surgeon during the Civil War, and upon his return he
resumed his legal career, continuing to his death in 1876. Aside
from his role in the Comstock medicine business, Lucius also
rates a footnote in United States political history as the
foreman of the grand jury that indicted Boss Tweed in 1872.</p>
<br>
<h2>A New Partnership Formed</h2>
<p>The two proprietors of Comstock &amp; Brother at 9 John Street
were the brothers George Wells and J. Carlton Comstock. At the
time of the events just related, their nephew, William Henry
Comstock, was an employee, but not a partner, of the firm (he was
the "clerk" who had removed the controversial letters from the
post office). This partnership was terminated by the death on
September 17, 1853, of J. Carlton Comstock, the inventor of the
veterinary medicines.<br>
<br>
To continue the business, a new partnership, also under the name
of Comstock &amp; Brother, comprising George Wells Comstock,
William Henry Comstock, and Baldwin L. Judson, was formed on
October 1, 1853. Judson was the husband of Eliza, a sister of
Lucius and his brothers. George contributed one half of the
capital of the new firm and the other two, one quarter each;
however, exclusive possession of all trademarks, recipes, and
rights to the medicines was reserved to George. It is not clear
precisely when Judson entered the drug business or first became
associated with the Comstocks; there is some evidence that he had
previously been in business for himself, as several remedies were
registered by him prior to this time. Judson's Chemical Extract
was registered with the Smithsonian by the Comstock firm in 1851,
but Dr. Larzetti's Juno Cordial or Procreative Elixir had
previously been entered by Judson &amp; Co. in 1844. A variant of
the Juno Cordial label also mentions Levi Judson (a father?) as
Dr. Larzetti's only agent in America.<br>
<br>
Besides the "new" remedies, the Comstock firm&mdash;both Comstock
firms&mdash;was also selling all of the "old" patent medicines,
most of them of British origin. These included such items as
Godfrey's Cordial, Bateman's Pectoral Drops, Turlington's Balsam
of Life, British Oil, and others. The only strictly American
product that could claim a venerability somewhat approaching
these was Samuel Lee's Bilious Pills, patented on April 30,
1796.<br>
<br>
Most of the more recent remedies probably had been originated by
local doctors or druggists, either upon experimentation or
following old folk remedies, and after enjoying some apparent
success were adopted by drug manufacturers. With rare exceptions,
however, the names of the discoverers never seem to have made
their way into medical history.</p>

<h2>Entrance of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills</h2>
<p>During the summer of 1855 the Comstock firm, now located at 50
Leonard Street, was approached by one Andrew J. White, who
represented himself as the sole proprietor of Dr. Morse's Indian
Root Pills and who had previously manufactured them in his own
business, conducted under the name of A.B. Moore, at 225 Main
Street, in Buffalo. Actually, White's main connection with this
business had been as a clerk, and he had been taken in as a
partner only recently. Nevertheless, the Comstocks accepted his
claims&mdash;carelessly, one must believe&mdash;and on August 10,
1855, signed a contract with White for the manufacture and
distribution of these pills.<br>
<br>
The originator of these pills was Andrew B. Moore. This is clear
from several legal documents, including an injunction proceeding
in behalf of White and Moore in 1859, which reads in part as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>The defendant Moore always had an equal right with
White to manufacture the pills&mdash;and by the agreement of 21st
June, 1858 Moore is (illegible) to his original right and the
defendants are manufacturing under Moore's original right....<br>
<br>
The plaintiffs (the Comstocks) by their acts have disenabled
Moore from using <i>his own name</i>.... (emphasis in
original).</blockquote>

In an undated form of contract, between Moore on the one part and
George Comstock, William H. Comstock, Judson, and White on the
other part, the parties agree, at Moore's option, either to sell
all rights and interest in Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills to him,
or to buy them from him, but in the latter event he must covenant
that "he will forever refrain from the manufacture or sale of any
medicine called Dr. Morse's Root Pills, Moore's Indian Root
Pills, or Morse's Pills, or Moore's Pills, or any other name or
designation similar to or resembling in any way either
thereof...."<br>
<br>
In brief, there never was a Dr. Morse&mdash;other than Andrew B.
Moore. And the Comstocks never claimed any origin of the pills in
legal documents, other than their purchase from White.
Subsequently, the company fabricated a lengthy history of the
discovery of the pills and even pictured Dr. Morse with his
"healthy, blooming family." This story was printed in almanacs
and in a wrapper accompanying every box of pills. According to
this version, "the famous and celebrated Dr. Morse," after
completing his education in medical science, traveled widely in
Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America, and spent three years
among the Indians of our western country, where he discovered the
secret of the Indian Root Pills. Returning from one of these
journeys after a long absence, he found his father apparently on
his death bed. But let us quote the story directly:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>A number of years ago this good man was very sick. He
had eight of the most celebrated doctors to attend him both night
and day. With all their skill this good and pious gentleman grew
worse, and finally they gave him up, saying that it was
impossible to cure him and he would soon die ... In the afternoon
he was taken with shortness of breath and supposed to be dying.
The neighbors were sent for, the room soon filled, and many
prayers were offered up from the very hearts of these dear
Christian people, that some relief might be obtained for this
good and pious man.<br>
<br>
While these prayers were ascending like sweet incense to the
throne above, and every eye was bathed in tears, a rumbling noise
was heard in the distance, like a mighty chariot winding its way
near, when all at once a fine span of horses, before a beautiful
coach, stood before the door, out of which alighted a noble and
elegant-looking man. In a moment's time he entered the room, and
embraced the hand of his dear father and mother. She clasped her
arms around his neck and fainted away.<br>
<br>
The Doctor, surprised to see his father so nearly gone,
immediately went to his coach, taking therefrom various plants
and roots, which he had learned from the Red Men of the forest as
being good for all diseases, and gave them to his father, and in
about two hours afterwards he was much relieved.... Two days
afterwards he was much better, and the third day he could walk
about the room ...and now we behold him a strong, active man, and
in the bloom of health, and at the age of ninety-five able to
ride in one day thirty-five miles, in order to spend his birthday
with this celebrated Doctor, his son.<br>
<br>
</blockquote>
The foregoing event was supposed to have occurred some years
before 1847, as the elder Mr. Morse's ninety-fifth birthday
referred to was celebrated on November 20, 1847, when he was
still hale and hearty. The old gentleman was also said to be
enormously wealthy, "with an income of about five hundred
thousand dollars annually, and the owner of a number of fine,
elegant ships, which sailed in different directions to every part
of the world." Dr. Morse, who was the first man to establish that
all diseases arise from the impurity of the blood, subsequently
discarded his regular practice of medicine and, as a boon to
mankind, devoted his entire energy to the manufacture of Dr.
Morse's Indian Root Pills.

This story, which was first disseminated as early as the late
1850s, was an entire fabrication. Throughout the patent-medicine
era it was the common practice to ascribe an Indian, or at least
some geographically remote, origin to all of these nostrums and
panaceas. In the words of James Harvey Young, in his book on the
Social History of Patent Medicines:<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup><br>
<br>
<blockquote>From the 1820's onward the Indian strode nobly
through the American patent-medicine wilderness. Hiawatha helped
a hair restorative and Pocahontas blessed a bitters. Dr. Fall
spent twelve years with the Creeks to discover why no Indian had
ever perished of consumption. Edwin Eastman found a blood syrup
among the Comanches. Texas Charlie discovered a Kickapoo
cure-all, and Frank Cushing pried the secret of a stomach
renovator from the Zuni. (Frank, a famous ethnologist, had gone
West on a Smithsonian expedition.) Besides these notable
accretions to pharmacy, there were Modoc Oil, Seminole Cough
Balsam, Nez Perce Catarrh Snuff, and scores more, all doubtless
won for the use of white men by dint of great cunning and
valor.</blockquote>
Judson's Mountain Herb Pills, a companion product of the Indian
Root Pills, had an even more romantic origin&mdash;so remarkable,
in fact, that the story was embodied in a full-scale paperback
novel published by B.L. Judson &amp; Co. in 1859. According to
this book, the remedy was discovered&mdash;or at least revealed
to the world&mdash;by a famous adventurer, Dr. Cunard. Dr.
Cunard's career somehow bore a remarkable similarity to that of
Dr. Morse. He was also the scion of a wealthy family who spent
much time traveling throughout the world, and in this process
becoming fluent in no less than thirty languages. Eventually he
encountered an Aztec princess about to be tortured and sacrificed
by Navajo Indians; he interrupted this ceremony only to be
captured himself, but by virtue of successfully foretelling an
eclipse (happily he had his almanac with him) he won release for
himself and the princess. Thereafter he led her back to her home,
in some remote part of Mexico, and lived among her people for a
year. As a boon for having saved the princess, he was given
possession of the ancient healing formula of the Aztecs. Upon
returning home Dr. Cunard, in an experience very similar to Dr.
Morse's, found his mother on her death bed, but he effected an
instant cure by the use of the miraculous herbs he had brought
with him. The news spread, soon a wide circle of neighbors was
clamoring for this medicine, and in order that all mankind might
share in these benefits, Dr. Cunard graciously conveyed the
secret to B.L. Judson &amp; Co.<br>
<br>
These stories were told entirely straightforwardly, with the
intention of being believed. How widely they were actually
accepted is difficult to say. In retrospect it seems extremely
curious that persons as prominent, as successful, as wealthy as
Dr. Morse and Dr. Cunard were never seen or heard by the public,
were never mentioned in the newspapers, never ran for public
office, their names never listed in any directories, biographies
or encyclopedias, and in fact they were not noticed
anywhere&mdash;except in the advertising material of Comstock
&amp; Co. and B.L. Judson. Perhaps such credulity was not unusual
in the 1850s, before the advent of widely distributed newspapers
and other means of communication, but more than fifty years
later, in the early years of the present century, essentially the
same version of the history of Dr. Morse was still being printed
in the Comstock almanacs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>The Struggle for Control of the Indian Root Pills</h2>
The agreement of August 10, 1855, between Andrew J. White and the
Comstocks established a partnership "for the purpose of
manufacturing and selling Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and for
no other purpose," the partners thereof being A.J. White as an
individual and Comstock &amp; Brother as a firm. The new
partnership was named A.J. White &amp; Co., but White contributed
no money or property&mdash;nothing but the right to Dr. Morse's
Indian Root Pills. The Comstock firm supplied all of the tangible
assets, together with the use of their existing business
premises. In turn, Comstock was to receive three fourths and
White one fourth of the profits. In brief, the new firm, although
bearing White's name, was controlled by the Comstocks.<br>
<br>
It is not clear why Moore, the originator of the pills, was not
taken into the new business or otherwise recognized in the
agreement. As we have seen, White claimed absolute ownership of
Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills, but Moore evidently did not agree,
for he continued to manufacture and peddle his own pills, at the
same time denouncing those prepared by A.J. White &amp; Co. under
Comstock control as forgeries. Moore had previously been in
business in Buffalo, at 225 Main Street, under his own name; an
announcement in the 1854 Buffalo City Directory (the
<i>Commercial Advertiser</i>) describes his firm as successor
both to C.C. Bristol and to Moore, Liebetrut &amp; Co. The same
directory shows White as merely a clerk at Moore's place of
business, although he was made a partner sometime during
1854.<br>
<br>
Cyrenius C. Bristol, whose business Moore took over, had entered
the drug trade in 1832, initially in partnership with a Dr. G.E.
Hayes. In the drug field his best known preparation was Bristol's
renowned sarsaparilla, and he is credited with having originated
the patent-medicine almanac, along with other advertising
innovations. The patent-medicine business, however, represented
merely one of his wide-ranging interests; he was also a co-owner
of vessels plying the Great Lakes, a publisher, and a dabbler in
such occult arts as Mesmerism, Phrenology, and Morse's theory of
the electric telegraph. In 1855 he appeared as the proprietor of
the <i>Daily Republic</i>, and it was perhaps his growing
involvement in publishing that led him to turn his drug business
over to Moore.<br>
<br>
While we know this much about Moore's antecedents, a very
considerable mystery remains. If Moore was the proprietor of his
own apparently prosperous drug and medicine business in Buffalo
in 1854, with White as one of his clerks, how did it happen that
in the following year White represented himself to the Comstocks
as the sole owner of Dr. Morse's (Moore's) Indian Root Pills? And
Moore, although he initially disputed this claim, left his own
business in Buffalo and ultimately joined White and the
Comstocks, not even in the capacity of a partner, but merely as
an employee.<br>
<br>
These events would seem, however, to date the origin of the
Indian Root Pills fairly closely. Moore was already manufacturing
them in Buffalo prior to White's initial agreement with the
Comstocks, but as he did not mention them by name in his
<i>Commercial Advertiser</i> announcement in 1854, it is a fair
presumption that the pills were new at this time. But they must
have caught on very rapidly to induce the Comstocks to enter a
partnership with White, under his name, when he contributed only
the Indian Root Pills but no cash or other tangible assets. <br>

While manufacturing the pills in Buffalo, Moore had been
packaging them under a yellow label bearing a pictorial
representation of the British coat-of-arms, flanked on one side
by an Indian and on the other by a figure probably supposed to
represent a merchant or a sea captain. The labels also described
Moore as the proprietor, "without whose signature none can be
genuine." And after the formation of A.J. White &amp; Co. and the
purported transfer of Dr. Morse's pills to it, Moore still
continued to sell the same medicine and to denounce the
White-Comstock product as spurious. The latter was packaged under
a white label showing an Indian warrior riding horseback and was
signed "A.J. White &amp; Co." While the color was shortly changed
to blue and the name of the proprietor several times amended
through the ensuing vicissitudes, the label otherwise remained
substantially unchanged for as long as the pills continued to be
manufactured, or for over 100 years.<br>
<br>
The nuisance of Moore's independent manufacture of the pills was
temporarily eliminated when, on June 21, 1858, Moore was hired by
A.J. White &amp; Co.<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup> and abandoned
competition with them. The Comstocks, in employing him, insisted
upon a formal, written agreement whereunder Moore agreed to
discontinue any manufacture or sale of the pills and to assign
all rights and title therein, together with any related
engravings, cuts, or designs, to A.J. White &amp; Co. As
previously stated, the two Comstock brothers, Judson, and White
had offered either to sell the Indian Root Pill business in its
entirety to Moore, or to buy it from him. Moore's employment by
A.J. White &amp; Co. presumably followed his election not to
purchase and operate the business himself.<br>
<br>
So far so good. The Comstocks' claim to the Indian Root Pills
through the 75 percent controlled A.J. White &amp; Co. now seemed
absolutely secure and the disparagement of their products at an
end. But new dissension must have occurred, for on New Year's Day
of 1859, without prior notice, Moore and White absented
themselves from the Comstock office, taking with them as many of
the books, accounts, records, and other assets of A.J. White
&amp; Co. as they could carry. Forthwith they established a
business of their own, also under the name of A.J. White &amp;
Co., at 10 Courtlandt Street, where they resumed the manufacture
and distribution of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills, under a close
facsimile of the label already being used by the A.J.
White-Comstock firm.<br>
<br>
These events left the Comstocks in an embarrassing position. For
over three years they had been promoting the A.J. White trade
name, but now they could hardly keep a competitor from operating
under his own name. Their official attitude was that the old firm
of A.J. White &amp; Co. was still in existence and controlled by
the Comstocks. But shortly they conceded this point tacitly when
they introduced new labels for the Indian Root Pills, under the
name and signature of B. Lake Judson, and advised that any
accounts or correspondence with A.J. White &amp; Co. still
outstanding should be directed to the new firm of Judson.<br>
<br>
Obviously, this state of affairs was extremely confusing to all
of the customers. Judson traveled widely through the Canadian
maritime provinces and prevailed upon many merchants to disavow
orders previously given to the new A.J. White firm at 10
Courtlandt Street. On April 28, 1859, White and Moore, for their
part, appointed one James Blakely of Napanee, Canada West, to
represent them in the territory between Kingston and Hamilton
"including all the back settlements," where he should engage in
the collection of all notes and receipts for the Indian Root
Pills and distribute new supplies to the merchants. On all
collections he was to receive 25 percent; new medicines were to
be given out without charge except for freight. In his letter
accepting the appointment, Blakely advised that:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>I think the pills should be entered here so as to
avoid part of the enormous duty. 30% is too much to pay. I think
there might be an understanding so that it might be done with
safety. Goods coming to me should come by Oswego and from thence
by Steamer to Millport. By this route they would save the delay
they would be subject to coming by Kingston and avoid the
scrutiny they would give them there at the
customhouse.</blockquote>

</table>
The great bulk of the notes and accounts which were assigned to
Blakely for collection were undoubtedly accounts originally
established with the old A.J. White &amp; Co. and therefore in
dispute with the Comstocks. But in any case, Blakely went
vigorously up and down his territory, frequently crossing the
paths of agents of the Comstocks, pushing the pills and
attempting to collect outstanding bills owed to A.J. White &amp;
Co. by persuasion and threats. On July 2, 1860, he wrote
that:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
My sales have been pretty good. Comstock Pills are put in
almost every place, generally on commission at a low figure, but
I get them put aside in most cases and make actual sales so they
will be likely to get them back. </blockquote>
<br>
Meanwhile, back in New York City, the fight between the erstwhile
partners went on, mostly in the legal arena. On April 14, 1859,
the sheriff, at the instigation of the Comstocks, raided White's
premises at 10 Courtlandt Street and seized the books, accounts,
and correspondence carried away by White and Moore on January 1.
Simultaneously, the Comstocks succeeded in having White and Moore
arrested on a charge of larceny "for stealing on last New Year's
Day a large number of notes and receipts," and in September White
was arrested on a charge of forgery. Since the alleged offense
took place in Pennsylvania, he was extradited back to that state.
Neither the circumstances nor the disposition of this case is
known, but since White claimed the right to collect notes issued
by the old A.J. White &amp; Co., it is probable that the charge
arose merely out of his endorsement of some disputed note. On
this occasion the Comstocks printed and distributed circulars
which were headed: "Andrew J. White, the pill man indicted for
forgery," and thereunder they printed the requisition of the
governor of New York in response to the request for extradition
from Pennsylvania, in such a way as to suggest that their side of
the dispute had official sanction.<br>
<br>
The Comstocks must also have discovered White's and Blakely's
arrangement for avoiding "scrutiny" of their goods shipped into
Canada, for on July 29 there was an acknowledgment by the
Collector of Customs of the Port of Queenston of certain
information supplied by George Wells Comstock, William Henry
Comstock, and Baldwin L. Judson on goods being "smuggled into
this province."<br>
<br>
While the principal case between the Comstocks and White and
Moore was scheduled for trial in December 1860, no documents
which report its outcome were discovered. However, it is a fair
surmise that the rival parties finally realized that they were
spending a great deal of energy and money to little avail,
injuring each other's business in the process and tarnishing the
reputation of the Indian Root Pills regardless of ownership. In
any case, a final settlement of this protracted controversy was
announced on March 26, 1861, when White and Moore relinquished
all claims and demands arising out of the sale of Dr. Morse's
Indian Root Pills prior to January 1, 1859. <br>

</table>
Since no copy of this agreement was found, we do not know what
inducement was offered to Moore and White. However, hundreds of
announcements of the settlement, directed "To the debtors of the
late firm of A.J. WHITE &amp; CO." were printed, advising
that<br>
<br>

<blockquote>The controversy and the difficulties between the
members of the old firm of A.J. White &amp; Co. of No. 50 Leonard
Street, New York, being ended, we hereby notify all parties to
whom MORSE'S INDIAN ROOT PILLS were sent or delivered prior to
January 1, 1859, and all parties holding for collection or
otherwise, any of said claims or demands for said Pills, that we
the undersigned have forever relinquished, and have now no claim,
right, title or interest in said debts or claims, and authorize
the use of the names of said firm whenever necessary in
recovering, collecting and settling such debts and
claims.</blockquote>
The announcement was signed by Andrew J. White and Andrew B.
Moore.<br>
<br>
This should have been the end of this wearisome affair, but it
was not. It soon appeared that Moore had violated this agreement
by concealing a number of accounts, together with a quantity of
pills, circulars, labels, and a set of plates, and, in the words
of Comstock's complaint, transferred them "to James Blakely, an
irresponsible person in Canada West." And Blakely evidently
continued to collect such accounts for the benefit of himself and
Moore. However, the Comstocks also entered the scene of strife,
and sometime during the summer of 1862 William Henry Comstock,
then traveling in Ontario, collected a note in the amount of
$7.50 in favor of A.J. White &amp; Co., as he had every right to
do, but endorsed it "James Blakely for A.J. White &amp; Co."
Blakely, when he learned of this, charged Comstock with forgery;
Comstock in turn charged Blakely with libel. Comstock probably
defended his somewhat questionable endorsement by the agreement
of March 26 of the previous year; in any event the case was
dismissed by a Justice of the Peace in Ottawa without comment. In
New York City, on November 25, the Comstocks had Moore arrested
again, with White at this time testifying in their support. There
was also an attempt to prosecute Blakely in Canada; his defense
was that he had bought the disputed accounts and notes from Moore
on March 11, 1861&mdash;a few days before the agreement with the
Comstocks&mdash;and that his ownership of these notes was
thereafter absolute and he was no longer working as an agent for
Moore.<br>
<br>
This controversy was still in the courts as late as April of
1864, and its final outcome is not known. But in any case, aside
only from Moore's and Blakely's attempts to collect certain
outstanding accounts and to dispose of stock still in their
hands, the agreement of March 26, 1861, left the Comstocks in
full and undisputed possession of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills.
White thereafter continued in the patent-medicine business in New
York City on his own; his firm was still active as recently as
1914. The subsequent history of Moore is unknown.<br>

<h2>The Brothers Part Company</h2>
One would imagine that the three partners of Comstock &amp;
Brother would have been exhausted by litigation and would be
eager to work amicably together for years. But such was not to be
the case. The recovered records give notice of a lawsuit (1866)
between George Comstock on the one hand and William H. Comstock
and Judson on the other. No other documents relating to this case
were found, and thus the precise issue is not known, or how it
was finally settled. However, it was obviously a prelude to the
dissolution of the old firm.<br>
<br>
Letters and documents from the several years preceding this event
suggest that Judson had become more prominent in the business,
and that he and William H. Comstock had gradually been drawing
closer together, perhaps in opposition to George. Judson,
although a partner of Comstock &amp; Brother, also operated under
his own name at 50 Leonard Street and had originated several of
the medicines himself. It is not clear whether the old firm of
Comstock &amp; Brother was formally dissolved, but after 1864
insurance policies and other documents referred to the premises
as "Comstock &amp; Judson." In 1863 the federal internal revenue
license in connection with the new "temporary" Civil War tax on
the manufacturing of drugs<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup> was issued simply
to B.L. Judson &amp; Co., now located, with the Comstocks, at 106
Franklin Street.<br>

During this period Judson and William Henry Comstock became
interested in a coffee-roasting and spice-grinding business,
operated under the name of Central Mills, and located in the
Harlem Railroad Building at the corner of Centre and White
Streets. Possibly George objected to his partners spreading their
energies over a second business; in any case, dissension must
have arisen over some matter. On April 1, 1866, balance sheets
were drawn up separately for B.L. Judson &amp; Co. and Comstock
&amp; Judson; the former showed a net worth of $48,527.56 against
only $5,066.70 for the latter. Both of these firms had a common
bookkeeper, E. Kingsland, but the relationship between the firms
is not known.<br>
<br>
On April 25, Judson and William H. Comstock sold their
coffee-roasting business to one Alexander Chegwidden, taking a
mortgage on the specific assets, which included, besides roasters
and other machinery, a horse and wagon. But if this had been a
factor in the controversy among the partners, the sale failed to
end it, for we find that on December 21, 1866, George W. obtained
an injunction against William Henry and Judson restraining them
from collecting or receiving any accounts due the partnership of
B.L. Judson &amp; Co., transferring or disposing of any of its
assets, and continuing business under that name or using any of
its trademarks. Unfortunately, we have no information as to the
details of this case or the terms of settlement, but we do find
that on February 1, 1867, the law firm of Townsend, Dyett &amp;
Morrison rendered a bill for $538.85 to B.L. Judson and William
H. Comstock for "Supervising and engrossing two copies of
agreement with George W. Comstock on settlement" and for
representing the two parties named in several actions and cross
actions with George.<br>
<br>
This settlement, whatever its precise character may have been,
obviously marked the termination of the old partnership&mdash;or,
more properly, the series of successor partnerships&mdash;that
had been carried on by various of the Comstock brothers for over
thirty years. William Henry, the former clerk and junior
partner&mdash;although also the son of the founder&mdash;was now
going it alone. Before this time he had already transferred the
main center of his activities to Canada, and he must have been
contemplating the removal of the business out of New York
City.<br>
<br>
After this parting of the ways, George W. Comstock was associated
with several machinery businesses in New York City, up until his
death in 1889. During the Draft Riots of 1863 he had played an
active role in protecting refugees from the Colored orphanage on
43rd Street, who sought asylum in his house at 136 West 34th
Street.<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup><br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Dr. Morse's Pills Move to Morristown</h2>
In April 1867, the home of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and of
the other proprietary remedies was transferred from New York City
to Morristown, a village of 300 inhabitants on the bank of the
St. Lawrence River in northern New York State. This was not,
however, the initial move into this area; three or four years
earlier William H. Comstock had taken over an existing business
in Brockville, Ontario, directly across the river. No specific
information as to why the business was established here has been
found, but the surrounding circumstances provide some very good
presumptions.<br>
<br>
The bulk of the Comstocks' business was always carried on in
rural areas&mdash;in "the back-woods." Specifically, the best
sales territory consisted of the Middle West&mdash;what was then
regarded as "The West"&mdash;of the United States and of Canada
West, i.e., the present province of Ontario. A surviving ledger
of all of the customers of Comstock &amp; Brother in 1857
supplies a complete geographic distribution. Although New Jersey
and Pennsylvania were fairly well represented, accounts in New
York State were sparse, and those in New England negligible. And
despite considerable travel by the partners or agents in the
Maritime Provinces, no very substantial business was ever
developed there. The real lively sales territory consisted of the
six states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and
Iowa, which accounted for over two thirds of all domestic sales,
while Canada West contributed over 90 percent of Canadian sales.
More regular customers were to be found in Canada West&mdash;a
relatively compact territory&mdash;than any other single state or
province. The number of customers of Comstock &amp; Brother in
1857 by states and provinces follows: <br>

The concentration of this market and its considerable distance
from New York City at a time when transportation conditions were
still relatively primitive must have created many problems in
distribution. Moreover, the serious threat to the important
Canadian market imposed by White and Moore, although eventually
settled by compromise, must have emphasized the vulnerability of
this territory to competition.<br>
<br>
It was also probable that the office in lower Manhattan&mdash;at
106 Franklin Street after May 20, 1862&mdash;was found to be
increasingly congested and inconvenient as a site for mixing
pills and tonics, bottling, labeling, packaging and shipping
them, and keeping all of the records for a large number of
individual small accounts. A removal of the manufacturing part of
the business to more commodious quarters, adjacent to
transportation routes, must have been urgent.<br>
<br>
But why move to as remote a place as Morristown, New York, beyond
the then still wild Adirondacks? It is obvious that this location
was selected because the company already had an office and some
facilities in Brockville, Canada West.<br>
<br>
William H. Comstock must have first become established at
Brockville, after extensive peregrinations through Canada West,
around 1859 or 1860. During the dispute between A.J. White and
Comstock &amp; Judson, Blakely, the aggressive Canadian agent,
had written to White, on September 1, 1859, that he had heard
from "Mr. Allen Turner of Brockville" that the Comstocks were
already manufacturing Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills at St.
Catherines. Evidently the Comstocks thought of several possible
locations, for on July 2 of the following year Blakely advised
his principals that the Comstocks were now manufacturing their
pills in Brockville. Two years later, in November 1862, when
Blakely sued William H. Comstock for the forgery of a note, the
defendant was then described in the legal papers as "one Wm.
Henry Comstock of the town of Brockville Druggist." And in July
1865, Comstock was writing from Brockville to E. Kingsland, the
bookkeeper in New York City, telling him to put Brenner&mdash;the
bearer of the letter&mdash;"in the mill." Comstock had apparently
taken over an existing business in Brockville, as receipts for
medicines delivered by him describe him as "Successor to A.N.
M'Donald &amp; Co." Dr. McKenzie's Worm Tablets also seem to have
come into the Comstock business with this acquisition.<br>

This did not mean a final move to Brockville for William H.
Comstock; for several years he must have gone back and forth and
was still active in New York City as a partner of his brother and
of Judson. We have seen that he subsequently went into
partnership with Judson in the purchase of the coffee-roasting
business. In December 1866, he was a defendant in the lawsuit
initiated by his brother George, when he was still apparently
active in the New York City business. Nevertheless, he apparently
shifted the center of his activities to the Brockville area about
1860, relinquishing primary responsibility for affairs in New
York City to his brother and to Judson. <br>
<br>

We now find the Comstock business established at Brockville.
Exactly why a second plant was built at Morristown, right across
the river, is again a matter for conjecture. It is a fair
assumption, however, that customs duties or other restraints may
have interfered with the ability of the Canadian plant to supply
the United States market. Thus, facilities on the other side of
the border, but still close enough to be under common management,
must have become essential. In an era of water transportation,
Morristown was a convenient place from which to supply the
important middle western territory. Ogdensburg was the eastern
terminus of lake boats, and several lines provided daily service
between that point and Buffalo. The railroad had already reached
Ogdensburg (although not yet Morristown) so that rail
transportation was also convenient. And the farms of St. Lawrence
County could certainly be counted upon to supply such labor as
was necessary for the rather simple tasks of mixing pills and
elixirs and packaging them. Finally, the two plants were directly
across the river from each other&mdash;connection was made by a
ferry which on the New York side docked almost on the Comstock
property&mdash;so that both could easily be supervised by a
single manager. In fact, if it had not been for the unusual
circumstance that they were located in two different countries,
they could really have been considered as no more than separate
buildings constituting a single plant.<br>
<br>
Surviving receipts for various goods and services show that the
move to Morristown was carried out in March or April of 1867.
Although the Morristown undertaking was obviously regarded as a
continuation of the New York business, it was operated by William
Henry Comstock as the sole proprietor for many years, and the
terms of any settlement or subsequent relationship with Judson
are unknown. A "Judson Pill Co." was subsequently established at
Morristown, but this was no more than a mailing address for one
department of the Comstock business. What happened to Judson as
an individual is a mystery; like Moore, he quietly disappears
from our story.<br>
<br>
It is also puzzling that no record of the transfer of land to Mr.
Comstock upon the first establishment of the pill factory in
Morristown in 1867 can be found. The earliest deed discovered in
the St. Lawrence County records shows the transfer of waterfront
property to William Henry Comstock "of Brockville, Ontario," from
members of the Chapman family, in March 1876. Additional
adjoining land was also acquired in 1877 and 1882.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>The Golden Era</h2>
With the establishment of the Comstock patent-medicine business
at Morristown in 1867, this enterprise may be said to have
reached maturity. Over thirty years had passed since William
Henry's father had established its earliest predecessor in lower
Manhattan. Possession of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills was now
unchallenged, and this and the other leading brand names were
recognized widely in country drug stores and farmhouses over one
third of a continent. No longer did the medicines have to be
mixed, bottled, and packaged in cramped and dingy quarters above
a city shop; spacious buildings in an uncongested country village
were now being used. No further relocations would be necessary,
as operations exceeded their capacity, or as landlords might
elect to raise rents; the pill factory was to remain on the same
site for the following ninety years. And the bitter struggles for
control, perhaps acerbated because of the family relationship
among the partners, were now a thing of the past. William H.
Comstock was in exclusive control, and he was to retain this
position, first as sole proprietor and later as president, for
the remainder of his long life.<br>
<br>
The patent-medicine business as a whole was also entering, just
at this time, upon its golden era&mdash;the fifty-year span
between the Civil War and World War I. Improved transportation,
wider circulation of newspapers and periodicals, and cheaper and
better bottles all enabled the manufacturers of the proprietary
remedies to expand distribution&mdash;the enactment and
enforcement of federal drug laws was still more than a generation
in the future. So patent medicines flourished; in hundreds of
cities and villages over the land enterprising self-proclaimed
druggists devised a livelihood for themselves by mixing some
powders into pills or bottling some secret elixir&mdash;normally
containing a high alcoholic content or some other habit-forming
element&mdash;created some kind of a legend about this
concoction, and sold the nostrum as the infallible cure for a
wide variety of human (and animal) ailments. And many
conservative old ladies, each one of them a pillar of the church
and an uncompromising foe of liquor, cherished their favorite
remedies to provide comfort during the long winter evenings. But
of these myriads of patent-medicine manufacturers, only a scant
few achieved the size, the recognition, and wide distribution of
Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and the other leading Comstock
remedies. <br>

Of course, the continued growth of the business was a gradual
process; it did not come all at once with the move to Morristown.
Even in 1878, after eleven years in this village, the Comstock
factory was not yet important enough to obtain mention in Everts'
comprehensive <i>History of St. Lawrence County</i>.<sup><a href=
"#8">[8]</a></sup> But, as we have seen, additional land was purchased
in 1877 and 1882, obviously bespeaking an expansion of the
enterprise. In 1885, according to a time book, the pill factory
regularly employed about thirty persons, plus a few others on an
occasional basis.<br>
<br>
Mr. Comstock, from his residence across the river in Brockville,
was the manager of the business; however, the operations were
under the immediate charge of E. Kingsland, former chief clerk of
the Judson and Comstock offices in New York City, who was brought
up to Morristown as superintendent of the factory. E. Kingsland
was a cousin of Edward A. Kingsland, one of the leading
stationers in New York City, and presumably because of this
relationship, Kingsland supplied a large part of Comstock's
stationery requirements for many years. Kingsland in Morristown
retired from the plant in 1885 and was succeeded by Robert G.
Nicolson, who had been a foreman for a number of years. Nicolson,
a native of Glasgow, Scotland, was brought to America as a child,
first lived at Brockville, and then came to Morristown as foreman
in the pill factory shortly after it was established. He was
succeeded as superintendent by his own son, Robert Jr., early in
the present century.<br>
<br>
The great majority of the employees of the pill factory were
women&mdash;or, more properly, girls&mdash;in an era when it was
not yet common-place for members of the fair sex to leave the
shelter of their homes for paid employment. The wage rates during
the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s were $3 to $5 a week for girls and $7
to $12 a week for men; the last-named amount was an acceptable
rate at that time for a permanent and experienced adult man. The
factory management of this era was joyously unaware of minimum
wages, fair employment laws, social security, antidiscrimination
requirements, fair trade, food and drug acts, income taxes, and
the remaining panoply of legal restrictions that harass the
modern businessman. Since only a few scattered payroll records
have been recovered, Comstock's maximum employment during the
Morristown period is not known, or just when it was reached. In a
brief sketch of the Indian Root Pill business, however, Mrs.
Doris Planty, former Morristown town historian, mentions a work
force of from "40 to 50" around the turn of the century.<br>
<br>
In 1875, twenty years after its original projection, the Utica
&amp; Black River Railroad finally came through the village,
bisecting the Comstock property with a right-of-way thirty-six
feet wide and dividing it thereafter into a "lower shop," where
the pills and tonics were made, and the "upper shop," where the
medicines were packaged and clerical duties performed. The
superintendent and his family lived above the upper shop in an
apartment; it was in the spacious attic above this apartment that
the records of the business, in a scattered and ransacked
condition, were found. Inasmuch as the first recorded sale of
land to Comstock occurred in March 1876, almost simultaneously
with the arrival of the railroad, it is a fair surmise that the
second building was put up about this time.<br>
<br>
The coming of the railroad also put a station almost at the
doorstep of the factory, and thereafter many shipments came and
went by rail. The company's huge volume of mailings, often ten or
fifteen bags a day, was also delivered directly to the trains,
without going through the local post office. For some years,
however, heavy shipments, including coal for the factory's
boilers, continued to come by ship. The Brockville ferry also
operated from a dock immediately adjacent to the railroad
station; one end of the station was occupied by the United States
Customs House.<br>
<br>
Almost from the time of its arrival in Morristown, the Black
River Railroad operated a daily through Wagner Palace Sleeping
Car from New York City via Utica and Carthage, and service over
the same route was continued by the New York Central after it
took over the North Country railroads in 1891. This meant that
Mr. Comstock, when he had business in New York City, could linger
in his factory until the evening train paused at the station to
load the afternoon's outpouring of pills and almanacs, swing
aboard the waiting Pullman, and ensconce himself comfortably in
his berth, to awaken in the morning within the cavernous
precincts of Grand Central Station&mdash;an ease and convenience
of travel which residents of the North Country in the 1970s
cannot help but envy. The daily sleeping car through Morristown
to and from New York City survived as long as the railroad
itself, into the early 1960s, thus outlasting both of the
Comstocks&mdash;father and son. <br>
<br>
 The pills were originally mixed by hand. In the summer of 1880
the factory installed a steam engine and belt-driven pill-mixing
machinery. At least one rotary pill machine was purchased from
England, from J.W. Pindar, and delivered to Comstock at a total
cost (including ocean freight) of &pound;19-10-9&mdash;about
$100. One minor unsolved mystery is that a bill for a second,
identical machine made out to A.J. White&mdash;with whom Comstock
had not been associated for twenty years&mdash;is filed among the
Comstock records; it can only be surmised that at this time
Comstock and White were again on good terms, the memories of
lawsuits, arrests, and prosecutions long since forgotten, and
Comstock either ordered a machine in behalf of White or perhaps
agreed to take one off his hands. At the time of this expansion,
certain outbuildings and a dock for the unloading of coal were
erected adjoining the lower building. During 1881 an underwater
telegraph cable was laid between Morristown and Brockville,
allowing immediate communication between the two Comstock
factories.<br>
<br>
With the advent of the electrical age, around the turn of the
century, the Comstock factory also installed a generator to
supply lighting, the first in the locality to introduce this
amenity. The wires were also extended to the four or five
company-owned houses in the village, and then to other houses, so
that the company functioned as a miniature public utility. Its
electric lines in the village were eventually sold to the Central
New York Power Corporation and incorporated into that system.
Steam heat was also supplied to the railroad station and the
customs house, and the company pumped water out of the river to
the water tower on the hill above Pine Hill Cemetery, following
the installation of the public water system.<br>
<br>
In 1908, Comstock built a large hotel across the street from the
upper factory; sitting part way up the hill and surrounded by a
wide veranda, it represented a conspicuous feature in the village
and dominated the waterfront scene until its destruction by fire
in 1925. The Comstock family, in 1910, also built a town hall and
social center for the village. Adjacent to the lower shop a large
boathouse was erected to shelter Mr. Comstock's yacht, the
<i>Maga Doma</i>, a familiar sight on the river for many years.

In any large city, of course, a factory employing, at most, forty
or fifty workers would have passed unnoticed, and its owner could
hardly expect to wield any great social or political influence.
In a remote village like Morristown, things are quite different;
a regular employer of forty persons creates a considerable
economic impact. For two generations the Indian Root Pill factory
supplied jobs, in an area where they were always scarce, and at a
time when the old forest and dairy industries were already
beginning to decline. But the recital of its close associations
with the village makes it clear that the pill factory was more
than a mere employer; for ninety years it provided a spirit that
animated Morristown, pioneered in the introduction of utilities
and certain social services, linked the village directly with the
great outside world of drug stores and hypochondriacs, and
distinguished it sharply from other, languishing St. Lawrence
County villages. One may wonder whether Dr. Morse's Indian Root
Pills really did anyone any good. They certainly did heap many
benefits upon all citizens of Morristown.<br>

While there was only a single Comstock medicine business,
operated as a sole proprietorship until 1902, Comstock found it
convenient to maintain several dummy companies&mdash;really no
more than mailing addresses&mdash;for some years after the move
to the North. Thus, in Morristown was to be found, at least in
business and postal directories, besides the Comstock company
itself, two other proprietary manufacturers: Judson Pill Co. and
E. Kingsland &amp; Co.<br>
<br>
The Judson Pill Co. preserved the name of Comstock's former
partner, while use of the name E. Kingsland perhaps flattered the
vanity of the former chief clerk and later plant superintendent.
The major Kingsland product was Chlorinated Tablets, a sure cure
for coughs, colds, hoarseness, bronchial irritation, influenza,
diphtheria, croup, sore throat and all throat diseases; these
were especially recommended by Dr. MacKenzie, Senior Physician in
the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat (was there any such
hospital?) in London, England. The Kingsland pills were also
popularized under the name of Little Pink Granules.<br>
<br>
Over on the Canadian side of the river, where another plant
approximately the same size as the Morristown facilities was in
operation, the Comstock Company had assimilated the Dr. Howard
Medicine Co. Dr. Howard's leading remedies were his Seven Spices
for all Digestive Disorders and the Blood Builder for Brain and
Body. The latter, in the form of pills, was prescribed as a
positive cure for a wide array of ailments, but like many other
patent medicines of the era, it was hinted that it had a
particularly beneficial effect upon sexual vitality.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>They have an especial action (through the blood) upon
the SEXUAL ORGANS of both Men and Women. It is a well recognized
fact that upon the healthy activity of the sexual apparatus
depend the mental and physical well-being of every person come to
adult years. It is that which gives the rosy blush to the cheek,
and the soft light to the eye of the maiden. The elastic step,
the ringing laugh, and the strong right arm of the youth, own the
same mainspring. How soon do irregularities rob the face of
color, the eye of brightness! Everyone knows this. The blood
becomes impoverished, the victim PALE. This pallor of the skin is
often the outward mark of the trouble within. But to the sufferer
there arise a host of symptoms, chiefest among which are loss of
physical and nervous energy. Then Dr. Howard's BLOOD BUILDER
steps into the breach and holds the fort. The impoverished Blood
is enriched. The shattered nervous forces are restored. Vigor
returns. Youth is recalled. Decay routed. The bloom of health
again mantles the faded cheek. Improvement follows a few days'
use of the pills; while permanent benefit and cure can only
reasonably be expected when sufficient have been taken to enrich
the Blood.</blockquote>
Before the Blood Builder pills were taken, all their users were
advised to have their bowels thoroughly cleansed by a laxative
medicine and, happily, the company also made an excellent
preparation for this purpose&mdash;Dr. Howard's Golden Grains.
While the good doctor was modern enough&mdash;the circular quoted
from was printed in the 1890s&mdash;to recognize the importance
of the healthy activity of the sexual apparatus, such a
suggestion should not be carried too far&mdash;so we find that
the pills were also unrivaled for building up systems shattered
by debauchery, excesses, self-abuse or disease. Along with the
pills themselves was recommended a somewhat hardy regimen,
including fresh air, adequate sleep, avoidance of lascivious
thoughts, and bathing the private parts and buttocks twice daily
in ice-cold water.

A few years after their initial introduction, Dr. Howard's Blood
Builder Pills somehow became "electric"&mdash;this word
surrounded by jagged arrows prominently featured on the outer
wrapper&mdash;although the character of the improvement which
added this new quality was not explained anywhere. The literature
accompanying these remedies explained that "in the evening of an
active, earnest and successful life, and in order that the public
at large might participate in the benefit of his discoveries,"
Dr. Howard graciously imparted to the proprietors the
composition, methods of preparation, and modes of using these
medicines. In other words, he was obviously a public benefactor
of the same stamp as Dr. Morse and Dr. Cunard&mdash;although by
the final years of the century, the old story about the long
absence from home, the extended travels in remote lands, and the
sudden discovery of some remarkable native remedy would probably
have sounded a trifle implausible.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Putting the Pills Through</h2>
Given the characteristics of the patent-medicine business, its
most difficult and essential function was selling&mdash;or what
the Comstocks and their representatives frequently described in
their letters as "putting the pills through." During the full
century within which Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and their
companion remedies were distributed widely over North America
and, later, over the entire world, almost every form of
advertising and publicity was utilized. And it is a strong
presumption that the total costs of printing and publicity were
much larger than those of manufacture and packaging.<br>
<br>
Initially, the selling was done largely by "travelers" calling
directly upon druggists and merchants, especially those in rural
communities. All of the Comstock brothers, with the exception
perhaps of Lucius, seem to have traveled a large part of their
time, covering the country from the Maritime Provinces to the
Mississippi Valley, and from Ontario&mdash;or Canada
West&mdash;to the Gulf. Their letters to the "home office" show
that they were frequently absent for extended periods, visiting
points which at the very dawn of the railroad era, in the 1840s
and 1850s, must have been remote indeed. In the surviving letters
we find occasional references to lame horses and other
vicissitudes of travel, and one can also imagine the rigors of
primitive trains, lake and river steamers, stagecoaches, and
rented carriages, not to mention ill-prepared meals and dingy
hotel rooms.<br>
<br>
Judson seems to have handled Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. J.
Carlton Comstock, who died in 1853, covered the South and in fact
maintained a residence in New Orleans; prior to the opening of
the railroads, this city was also a point of entry for much of
the West. George Wells Comstock made several extensive tours of
the West, while William Henry spent much of his time in Canada
West and, as we have seen, lived in Brockville after 1860. Andrew
J. White spent most of his time traveling after he joined the
firm in 1855; Moore also covered Canada West intensively, briefly
for the Comstocks and then in opposition to them.<br>
<br>
Besides the partners themselves, the several successor Comstock
firms had numerous agents and representatives. As early as 1851,
during the dispute between Lucius and his brothers, it was stated
in a legal brief that the partnership included, besides its
manufacturing house in New York City, several hundred agencies
and depots throughout every state and county in the Union. This
assertion may have stretched the truth a bit, as most of the
agents must have handled other products as well, but the
distribution system for the pills was undoubtedly well organized
and widely extended. Several full-time agents did work
exclusively for the Comstocks; these included Henry S. Grew of
St. John's, Canada East, who said he had traveled 20,000 miles in
three years prior to 1853, and Willard P. Morse in the Middle
West, whose signature is still extant on numerous shipping
documents.<br>
<br>
While personal salemanship always must have been most effective
in pushing the pills&mdash;and also useful in the allied task of
collecting delinquent accounts&mdash;as the business grew the
territory was far too vast to be covered by travelers, and so
advertising was also used heavily. Hardly any method was
neglected, but emphasis was always placed upon two media:
almanacs and country newspapers.<br>
<br>
Millions of the almanacs poured out of the small Morristown
railroad station. In the early years of the present century, for
which the record has been found, from July until the following
April shipments of almanacs usually ran well in excess of one
million per month. At various times they were also printed in
Spanish and in German; the Spanish version was for export, but
the German was intended primarily for our own "native" Germans in
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and elsewhere throughout the Middle
West.<br>
<br>
Around the turn of the century, the patent-medicine almanac was
so common that one could walk into any drug store and pick up
three or four of them. Credit for the origination of the free
patent-medicine almanac has been ascribed to Cyrenius C. Bristol,
founder of the firm which Moore later took over and therefore an
indirect predecessor of the Indian Root Pills. Whether or not
this is strictly accurate, it is known that Bristol's
Sarsaparilla Almanac was being printed as early as 1843 and by
1848 had expanded into an edition of 64 pages. <br>

The Comstocks were almost as early. The first date they printed
almanacs is not known, but by 1853 it was a regular practice, for
the order book of that year shows that large batches of almanacs,
frequently 500 copies, were routinely enclosed with every
substantial order. Over their entire history it is quite
reasonable that somewhere in the vicinity of one billion almanacs
must have been distributed by the Comstock Company and its
predecessors. As a matter of fact, back in the 1850s there was
not merely a Comstock but also a Judson almanac. One version of
the latter was the "Rescue of Tula," which recounted Dr. Cunard's
rescue of the Aztec princess and his reward in the form of the
secret of the Mountain Herb Pills. In the 1880s, Morse's Indian
Root Pill almanac was a 34-page pamphlet, about two thirds filled
with advertising and testimonials&mdash;including the familiar
story of the illness of Dr. Morse's father and the dramatic
return of his son with the life-saving herbs&mdash;but also
containing calendars, astronomical data, and some homely good
advice. Odd corners were filled with jokes, of which the
following was a typical specimen:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>"Pa," said a lad to his father, "I have often read of
people poor<br>
 but honest; why don't they sometimes say, 'rich but
honest'"?<br>
<br>
 "Tut, tut, my son, nobody would believe them," answered the
father.<br>
</blockquote>
Before 1900 the detailed story of the discovery of Dr. Morse's
pills was abridged to a brief summary, and during the 1920s this
tale was abandoned altogether, although until the end the
principal ingredients were still identified as natural herbs and
roots used as a remedy by the Indians. In more recent years the
character and purpose of Dr. Morse's pills also changed
substantially. As recently as 1918, years after the passage of
the Federal Food and Drug Act of 1906, they were still being
recommended as a cure for:

Further, two entire pages were taken in the almanac to explain
how, on the authority of "the celebrated Prof. La Roche of
Paris," appendicitis could be cured by the pills without resort
to the surgeon's knife.<br>
<br>
Besides the almanacs, almost every known form of advertising in
the preradio era was employed. Announcements were inserted in
newspapers&mdash;apparently mostly rural newspapers&mdash;all
over the country; the two remedies pushed most intensively were
the Indian Root Pills and Judson's Mountain Herb Worm Tea. The
latter always bore a true likeness of Tezuco, the Aztec chief who
had originally conferred the secret of the medicine upon Dr.
Cunard. Besides the Mountain Herb Worm Tea, there were also
Mountain Herb Pills; it is not clear how the pills differed from
the tea, but they were recommended primarily as a remedy for<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Bowel Complaints Coughs Colds Chest Diseases
Costiveness Dyspepsia Diarrhoea Dropsy Debility Fever and Ague
Female Complaints Headaches Indigestion Influenza Inflammation
Inward Weakness Liver Complaints Lowness of Spirits Piles Stone
and Gravel Secondary Symptoms</blockquote>
with particular stress upon their value as a "great female
medicine." Besides the major advertisement of the pills,
consisting of an eight-inch column to be printed in each issue of
the paper, smaller announcements were provided, to be inserted
according to a specified monthly schedule among the editorial
matter on the inside pages. Sample monthly announcements from the
Judson Mountain Herb Pills contract used in 1860 were:<br>

<br>
 THE GREAT FEMALE MEDICINE<br>
<br>
 The functional irregularities peculiar to the weaker sex,

 invariably corrected without pain or inconvenience by the use
of<br>
 Judson's Mountain Herb Pills. They are the safest and surest<br>
 medicine for all the diseases incidental to females of all

 and more especially so in this climate.<br>
<br>
 Ladies who wish to enjoy health should always have these Pills.
No<br>
 one who ever uses them once will ever allow herself to be
without<br>
 them. They remove all obstructions, purify the blood and give
to<br>
 the skin that beautiful, clear and healthful look so greatly<br>
 admired in a beautiful and healthy woman. At certain periods
these<br>
 Pills are an indispensable companion. From one to four should
be<br>
 taken each day, until relief is obtained. A few doses
occasionally,<br>
 will keep the system healthy, and the blood so pure, that
diseases<br>
 cannot enter the body.<br>

 DISEASES OF THE CHEST AND LUNGS<br>
<br>
 These diseases are too well known to require any description.
How<br>
 many thousands are every year carried to the silent grave by
that<br>
 dread scourge Consumption, which always commences with a
slight<br>
 cough. Keep the blood pure and healthy by taking a few doses
of<br>
 JUDSON'S MOUNTAIN HERB PILLS each week, and disease of any kind
is<br>
 impossible. Consumption and lung difficulties always arise
from<br>
 particles of corrupt matter deposited in the air cells by
bad<br>
 blood. Purify that stream of life and it will soon carry off
and<br>
 destroy the poisonous matter; and like a crystal river
flowing<br>
 through a desert, will bring with it and leave throughout the
body<br>
 the elements of health and strength. As the river leaving
the<br>
 elements of fertility in its course, causes the before barren
waste<br>
 to bloom with flowers and fruit, so pure blood causes the frame
to<br>
 rejoice in strength and health, and bloom with unfading
beauty.<br>
</blockquote>
Any person who read the notices for both medicines carefully
might have noticed with some surprise that the Mountain Herb
Pills and the Indian Root Pills were somehow often recommended
for many of the same diseases. In fact, the Mountain Herb Pills
and the Indian Root Pills used identical text in explaining their
effect upon several disagreeable conditions. Always prominent in
this advertising were reminders of our fragile mortality and
warnings, if proper medication were neglected, of an untimely
consignment to the silent grave.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, newspapers in the South had been utilized
extensively just on the eve of the Civil War, and it undoubtedly
proved impossible to supply customers in that region during the
ensuing conflict. However, other advertising was given a military
flavor and tied in with the war, as witness the following (for
1865):<br>
<br>

<pre>
      GENERAL ORDERS&mdash;No. 1

      terms of this order, will receive a free pardon for pastoffences,
      and be restored to the Grand Army of General Health.

</pre>
Twenty years later, when the Civil War had passed out of recent
memory and Confederate currency was presumably becoming a
curiosity, Comstock printed facsimiles of $20 Confederate
bills,<sup><a href="#9">[9]</a></sup> with testimonials and advertisements
upon the reverse side; it can be assumed that these had enough
historical interest to circulate widely and attract attention,
although each possessor must have felt a twinge of disappointment
upon realizing that his bill was not genuine but merely an
advertising gimmick.<br>
<br>
Back in the 1850s, the Comstock Company in lower Manhattan had an
advertising agent, one Silas B. Force, whose correspondence by
some unexplained happenstance was also deposited in the loft of
the Indian Root Pill building in Morristown, even though he was
not an exclusive agent and served other clients besides the
Comstocks. One of these was Dr. Uncas Brant, for whom Force had
the following announcement printed in numerous papers:<br>
<br>

<pre>
      AN OLD INDIAN DOCTOR WHO HAD made his fortune and retired from
      business, will spend the remainder of his days in curing that
      dreadful disease&mdash;CONSUMPTION&mdash;FREE OF CHARGE: his earnest desire
      being to communicate to the world his remedies that have proved
      successful in more than 3,000 cases. He requires each applicant to
      send him a minute description of the symptoms, with two Stamps (6
      cts) to pay the return letter, in which he will return his <i>advice
      prescription</i>, with directions for preparing the medicines &amp;c.

      <i>The Old Doctor</i> hopes that those afflicted will not, on account of
      delicacy, refrain from consulting him because he makes <i>No Charge</i>.
      His sole object in advertising is to do all the good he can, before
      he dies. He feels that he is justly celebrated for cure of
      Consumption, Asthma, Bronchitis, Nervous Affections, Coughs, Colds,
      &amp;c.

</pre>
This type of an apparently free diagnosis of medical ills,
prompted solely by the benevolence of some elderly or retired
person, was a familiar petty swindle around the middle of the
last century. The newspapers carried many such announcements from
retired clergymen, old nurses, or Indian doctors, frequently
persons who had themselves triumphed over dread diseases and had
discovered the best remedies only after years of search and
suffering, always offering to communicate the secret of recovery
to any fellow sufferer. The victim would receive in reply a
recipe for the proper medicine, always with the advice that great
care must be taken to prepare it exactly as directed, and with
the further advice that if the ingredients should not prove to be
conveniently available the benevolent old doctor or retired
clergyman could provide them for a trifling sum. Invariably, the
afflicted patient would discover that the ingredients specified
were obscure ones, not kept by one druggist in a hundred and
unknown to most of them. Thus, he would be obliged, if he
persisted in the recommended cure, to send his money to the
kindly old benefactor. Frequently, he would receive no further
reply or, at best, would receive some concoction costing only a
few cents to compound. The scheme was all the safer as it was
carried on exclusively by mail, and the swindler would usually
conclude each undertaking under any given name before
investigation could be initiated.<br>
<br>
Besides participating in such schemes, Force apparently devoted a
large part of his energy in collecting accounts due him or, in
turn, in being dunned by and seeking to postpone payment to
newspapers with whom he was delinquent in making settlement.<br>
<br>
Other forms of advertising employed over the years included
finely engraved labels, circulars and handbills, printed
blotters, small billboards, fans, premiums sent in return for
labels, a concise&mdash;<i>very</i> concise&mdash;reference
dictionary, and trade cards of various sorts. One trade card
closely resembled a railroad pass; this was in the 1880s when
railroad passes were highly prized and every substantial citizen
aspired to own one. Thus, almost everyone would have felt some
pride in carrying what might pass, at a glance, as a genuine pass
on the K.C.L.R.R.; although it was signed only by "Good Health"
as the general agent, entitled the bearer merely to ride on foot
or horseback and was actually an advertisement of Kingsland's
Chlorinated Tablets. Another card played somewhat delicately but
still unmistakably on the Indian Root Pills' capacity to restore
male virility. This card pictured a fashionably dressed tomcat,
complete with high collar, cane and derby, sitting somewhat
disconsolately on a fence as the crescent moon rose behind him,
with these reflections:<br>
<br>

<pre>
   How terribly lonesome I feel! How queer,
   To be sitting alone, with nobody near,
   Oh, how I wish Maria was here,
                       Mon dieu!
   The thought of it fills me with horrible doubt,
   I should smile, I should blush, I should wail,
           I should shout,
   Just suppose some fellow has cut me out!
                             Me out!

Testimonials submitted voluntarily by happy users of the pills
were always widely featured in the almanacs, newspaper
advertisements, and handbills. Although the easy concoction of
the stories about Dr. Morse and Dr. Cunard might suggest that
there would have been no hesitation in fabricating these
testimonials, it is probable that they were genuine; at least,
many have survived in the letters scattered over the floor of the
Indian Root Pill factory. In some cases one might feel that the
testimonials were lacking in entire good faith, for many of them
were submitted by dealers desiring lenient credit or other
favors. Witness, for example, the following from B. Mollohan of
Mt. Pleasant, Webster County, West Va., on April 16, 1879:<br>
<br>
<pre>
     Pleas find here enclosed Two Dollars &amp; 50 cts $2 <i>50</i> cts for which
     pleas place to my credit and return receipt to me for same. I cant
     praise your Dr Morse pill two high never before in all my
     recolection has there bin a meddison here that has given such
     general satisfaction. I hope the pills will always retain their
     high standing and never bee counterfeited.... I could sell any amt
     Pills allmost if money was not so scarce. I have to let some out on
     credit to the Sick and Poor &amp; wait some time though I am
     accountable to you for all I recd &amp; will pay you as fast as I sell
     &amp; collect ... I have about one Doz Box on hand.
</pre>
Mollohan's complaint about the shortage of money and the long
delay in collecting many accounts reflected a condition that
prevailed throughout the nineteenth century. Money was scarce,
and the economy of many rural communities was still based largely
on the barter system, so that it was very difficult for farmers
to generate cash for store goods. Consequently, country
storekeepers had to be generous in extending credit, and, in
turn, manufacturers and jobbers had to be lenient in enforcing
collection.<br>
<br>
Not all of the storekeepers could write as neatly and clearly as
Mollohan. The following letter, quoted in full, from Thomas
Cathey of Enfield, Illinois, on January 23, 1880, not merely
presented a problem relating to the company's policy of awarding
exclusive territories but offered considerable difficulty in
deciphering:<br>

Sadly, we do not know how the company handled Mr. Cathey's
request for sole representation in three Illinois townships.<br>
<br>
After the pills achieved wide recognition and other methods of
publicity, chiefly the almanacs, were well established, newspaper
advertising was terminated. An invitation to agents (about 1885)
declared that<br>
<br>

<blockquote>For some years past they have not been advertised in
newspapers, they being filled with sensational advertisements of
quack nostrums got up for no other purpose than catch-penny
articles ...</blockquote>
The Indian Root Pills obviously claimed a more lofty stature than
other, common proprietary remedies. The exclusive representation
scheme was also a partial substitution for newspaper advertising;
the company was aggressive in soliciting additional
agents&mdash;aiming at one in every town and village&mdash;and
then in encouraging them to push the pills by offering prizes
such as watches, jewelry, and table utensils.<sup><a href=
"#10">[10]</a></sup><br>
<br>
 What were the ingredients of the Indian Root Pills and the other
Comstock preparations? Originally, the formulas for the various
remedies were regarded as closely held secrets, divulged only to
proprietors and partners&mdash;and not even to all of
them&mdash;and certainly never revealed to the purchasers. But
despite this secrecy, charges of counterfeiting and imitating
popular preparations were widespread. In many cases, the alleged
counterfeits were probably genuine&mdash;to the extent that
either of these terms has meaning&mdash;for it was a recurrent
practice for junior partners and clerks at one drug house to
branch off on their own, taking some of the secrets with
them&mdash;just as Andrew B. White left Moore and joined the
Comstocks, bringing the Indian Root Pills with him.<br>
<br>
In the latter years, under the rules of the Federal Food and Drug
Act, the ingredients were required to be listed on the package ;
thus we know that the Indian Root Pills, in the 1930s and 1940s,
contained aloes, mandrake, gamboge, jalap, and cayenne
pepper.<br>
<br>
 <i>Aloe</i> is a tropical plant of which the best known
medicinal varieties come from Socotra and Zanzibar; those
received by the Comstock factory were generally described as Cape
(of Good Hope) <i>Aloe</i>. The juice <i>Aloes</i> is extracted
from the leaves of this plant and since antiquity has been
regarded as a valuable drug, particularly for its laxative and
vermifuge properties. <i>Mandrake</i> has always been reputed to
have aphrodisiac qualities. <i>Gamboge</i> is a large tree native
to Ceylon and Southeast Asia, which produces a resinous gum, more
commonly used by painters as a coloring material, but also
sometimes employed in medicine as a cathartic. <i>Jalap</i> is a
flowering plant which grows only at high altitudes in Mexico, and
its root produces an extract with a powerful purgative effect.
All of these ingredients possessed one especial feature highly
prized by the patent-medicine manufacturers of the nineteenth
century, i.e., they were derived from esoteric plants found only
in geographically remote locations. One does find it rather
remarkable, however, that the native Indian chiefs who confided
the secrets of these remedies to Dr. Morse and Dr. Cunard were so
familiar with drugs originating in Asia and Africa.<sup><a href=
"#11">[11]</a></sup> The Indians may very well have been acquainted
with the properties of jalap, native to this continent, but the
romantic circumstances of its discovery, early in the last
century seem considerably overdrawn, as the medicinal properties
of jalap were generally recognized in England as early as
1600.<br>
<br>
Whether the formula for the Indian Root Pills had been constant
since their "discovery"&mdash;as all advertising of the company
implied&mdash;we have no way of knowing for sure. However, the
company's book of trade receipts for the 1860s shows the
recurring purchase of large quantities of these five drugs, which
suggests that the ingredients did remain substantially unchanged
for over a century. For other remedies manufactured by the
company, the ingredients purchased included:
<table summary="ingredients" cellspacing="30" cellpadding="0"

</table>
It is not known where the calomel (mercurous chloride) and some
of the other harsher ingredients were used&mdash;certainly not in
the Indian Root Pills or the Mountain Herb Worm Tea&mdash;for the
company frequently incorporated warnings against the use of
calomel in its advertising and even promised rewards to persons
proving that any of its preparations contained calomel.<br>
<br>
Less active ingredients used to supply bulk and flavor included
alcohol, turpentine, sugar, corn starch, linseed meal, rosin,
tallow, and white glue. Very large quantities of sugar were used,
for we find that Comstock was buying one 250-pound barrel of
sugar from C.B. Herriman in Ogdensburg approximately once a
month. In the patent-medicine business it was necessary, of
course, that the pills and tonics must be palatable, neutralizing
the unpleasant flavor of some of the active ingredients;
therefore large quantities of sugar and of pleasant-tasting herbs
were required. It was also desirable, for obvious reasons, to
incorporate some stimulant or habit-forming element into the
various preparations.<br>
<br>
 A register of incoming shipments for the year 1905 shows that
the factory was still receiving large quantities of aloes,
gamboge, mandrake, jalap, and pepper. One new ingredient being
used at this time was talc, some of which originated at
Gouverneur, within a few miles of the pill manufactory, but more
of it was described as "German talc." The same register gives the
formulas for three of the company's other preparations. One of
these, the <i>Nerve &amp; Bone Liniment</i>, was simply
compounded of four elements:<br>
<br>

<pre>
    3 gal. Turpentine
    2 qts. Linseed Oil
    2 lbs. Hemlock
    2 lbs. Concentrated Amonia.
</pre>
The formula for the <i>Condition Powders</i> (for horses and
livestock) was far more complex, consisting of:<br>
<br>

<pre>
    4 lbs. Sulphur
    4 lbs. Saltpetre
    4 lbs. Black Antimony
    4 lbs. Feongreek Seed
    8 lbs. Oil Meal
    1-1/2 oz. Arsenic
    2 oz. Tart Antimony
    6 lbs. Powdered Rosin
    2 lbs. Salt
    2 lbs. Ashes
    4 lbs. Brand (Bran-?).
</pre>
The name of the third preparation was not given, but the
ingredients were:<br>
<br>
<pre>
    1 oz. Dry White Lead
    1 oz. Oxide of Zinc
    1/2 oz. Precipitated Chalk
    3 oz. Glycerine
    Add 1 lb. Glue.

All of the foregoing were medicines for which Lucius claimed to
be the sole proprietor&mdash;although it is improbable that he
manufactured all of them: several of them were probably identical
preparations under different labels. In addition to these, he
offered a larger list of medicines as a dealer. Brother J.
Carlton Comstock must have been the main originator of medicines
within the firm; he seems to have specialized largely in
veterinary remedies, although the liniment for the piles also
stood to his credit. Despite Lucius' claim to sole proprietorship
of these remedies, the departing brothers also manufactured and
sold most of the identical items, adding two or three additional
preparations, such as Dr. Chilton's Fever and Ague Pills and
Youatt's Gargling Oil (for animals). Aside from J. Carlton
Comstock and Judson, the originators of most of the other
preparations are cloaked in mystery; most of them were probably
entirely fictitious. Admittedly, William Youatt (1776-1847), for
whom several of the animal remedies were named, was an actual
British veterinarian and his prescriptions were probably genuine,
but whether he authorized their sale by proprietary manufacturers
or was himself rewarded in any way are questions for speculation.
The versatile Dr. Larzetti seems to have experimented both with
impotency and deafness, but his ear oil&mdash;a number of
specimens of which were still on hand in the abandoned
factory&mdash;was identical in every respect with Dr. McNair's
oil, as the labels and directions, aside only from the names of
the doctors, were exactly the same for both preparations. In
fact, some careless printer had even made up a batch of circulars
headed "Dr. Mc Nair's Acoustic Oil" but concluding with the
admonition, "Ask for Larzetti's Acoustic Oil and take no other."
Presumably simple Americans who were distrustful of foreigners
would take Mc Nair's oil, but more sophisticated persons, aware
of the accomplishments of doctors in Rome and Vienna, might
prefer Larzetti's preparation.<br>
<br>
 As the century moved along, the Comstock factory at Morristown
reduced the number of remedies it manufactured, and concentrated
on the ones that were most successful, which included, besides
the Indian Root Pills, Judson's Mountain Herb Pills, Judson's
Worm Tea, Carlton's Condition Powders, Carlton's Nerve &amp; Bone
Liniment, and Kingsland's Chlorinated Tablets. At some
undisclosed point, Carlton's Nerve &amp; Bone Liniment for
Horses, originally registered with the Smithsonian Institution on
June 30, 1851, ceased to be a medicine for animals and became one
for humans. And sometime around 1920 the Judson name disappeared,
the worm medicine thereafter was superseded by Comstock's Worm
Pellets. Long before this, Judson had been transposed into
somewhat of a mythical character&mdash;"old Dr. Judson"&mdash;who
had devised the Dead Shot Worm Candy on the basis of seventy
years' medical experience.<br>
<br>
During the final years of the Comstock business in Morristown, in
the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, only three items were manufactured
and sold: the Indian Root Pills, the Dead Shot Worm Pellets and
Comstock's N &amp; B Liniment.<sup><a href="#12">[12]</a></sup> The worm
pellets had been devised by Mrs. Hill, "an old English nurse of
various and extended experience in the foundling hospitals of
Great Britain."<br>
<br>
Besides its chemicals and herbs, the Comstock factory was a heavy
consumer of pillboxes and bottles. While the company advertised,
in its latter years, that "our pills are packaged in metal
containers&mdash;not in cheap wooden boxes," they were, in fact,
packaged for many decades in small oval boxes made of a thin
wooden veneer. These were manufactured by Ira L. Quay of East
Berne, New York, at a price of 12&cent; per gross. The pill
factory often must have been a little slow in paying, for Quay
was invariably prodding for prompt remittance, as in this letter
of December 25, 1868:<br>
<br>
<pre>
     Mr Wm h comstock
     Dear sir we have sent you one tierce &amp; 3 cases of pill boxes wich
     we want you to send us a check for as soon as you git this for we
     have to pay it the first of next month &amp; must have the money if you
     want eney moure boxes we will send them &amp; wait for the money till
     the first of april youres truly
                                                 Quay &amp; Champion
</pre>
Quay continued to supply the boxes for at least fifteen years,
during which his need for prompt payment never diminished.
Comstock also bought large quantities of bottles, corks, packing
boxes, and wrappers. Throughout the company's long existence,
however, more frequent payments were made to printers and
stationers&mdash;for the heavy flow of almanacs, handbills,
labels, trade cards, direction sheets, and billheads&mdash;than
for all the drugs and packaging materials. In the success
achieved by the Indian Root Pills, the printing press was just as
important a contributor as the pill-mixing machine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>The Final Years</h2>
When William Henry Comstock, Sr., moved the Indian Root Pill
business to Morristown, in 1867, he was&mdash;at age 37&mdash;at
least approaching middle life. Yet he was still to remain alive,
healthy, and in direct charge of the medicine business for more
than half a century longer. And the golden era of the
patent-medicine business may be said to have coincided very
closely with Mr. Comstock's active career&mdash;from about 1848
to 1919.<br>
<br>

While no schedule of sales, net income, or financial results are
available, the fragmentary records make it obvious that the
business continued to flourish beyond World War I, and long after
the passage of the first Food and Drug Act&mdash;in 1906. The
almanacs were still printed as recently as 1938; while the labels
and other advertising matter abandoned their ornate
nineteenth-century style and assumed a distinctly modern
aspect&mdash;to the extent of introducing comic-style picture
stories, featuring the small boy who lacked energy to make the
little league baseball team (he had worms), and the girl who
lacked male admirers because of pimples on her face (she suffered
from irregular elimination). Sales volume of the Morristown
factory, however, apparently did reach a peak early in the
present century&mdash;perhaps around 1910&mdash;and began a more
rapid decline during the 1920s. During this same period the
geographical character of the market shifted significantly; as
domestic orders dropped off, a very substantial foreign business,
particularly in Latin America, sprang up. While this did not
compensate fully for the loss of domestic sales, it did provide a
heavy volume that undoubtedly prolonged the life of the Indian
Root Pill factory by several decades.<br>
<br>
William Henry Comstock, Sr., who first came to Brockville in
1860, at a time when the struggle with White for the control of
the pills was still in progress, married a Canadian girl,
Josephine Elliot, in 1864; by this marriage he had one son,
Edwin, who lived only to the age of 28. In 1893 Comstock married,
for a second time, Miss Alice J. Gates, and it is a favorable
testimony to the efficacy of some of his own virility medicines
that at age 67 he sired another son, William Henry Comstock II
(or "Young Bill") on July 4, 1897. In the meanwhile, the elder
Comstock had become one of the most prominent citizens of
Brockville, which he served three terms as mayor and once
represented in the Canadian parliament. Besides his medicine
factories on both sides of the river, he was active in other
business and civic organizations, helped to promote the
Brockville, Westport &amp; Northwestern Railway, and was highly
regarded as a philanthropist. Although he lived well into the
automobile age, he always preferred his carriage, and acquired a
reputation as a connoisseur and breeder of horses. As remarked
earlier, his steam yacht was also a familiar sight in the upper
reaches of the St. Lawrence River.<br>
<br>
The medicine business in Morristown was operated as a sole
proprietorship by Comstock from the establishment here in 1867 up
until 1902, when it was succeeded by W.H. Comstock Co., Ltd., a
Canadian corporation. St. Lawrence County deeds record the
transfer of the property&mdash;still preserving the 36-foot strip
for the railroad&mdash;from personal to corporate ownership at
that time.<br>
<br>
Comstock&mdash;the same callow youth who had been charged with
rifling Lucius' mail in the primitive New York City of
1851&mdash;came to the end of his long life in 1919. He was
succeeded immediately by his son, William Henry II, who had only
recently returned from military service during World War I.
According to Mrs. Planty, former Morristown historian, "Young
Bill" had been active in the business before the war and was
making an inspection of the company's depots in the Orient, in
the summer of 1914, when he was stranded in China by the
cancellation of transpacific shipping services and was therefore
obliged to cross China and Russia by the Transiberian Railway.
This story, however, strains credulity a trifle, as the journey
would have brought him closer to the scene of conflict at that
time, and he was, in any event, only 17 years old when these
events are supposed to have occurred.<br>
<br>
The decline of the patent-medicine business was ascribed by
Stewart Holbrook in his <i>Golden Age of Quackery</i> to three
main factors: the Pure Food and Drug Acts; the automobile; and
higher standards of public education. All of these were, of
course, strongly in evidence by the 1920s, when William Henry
Comstock II was beginning his career as the head of the Indian
Root Pill enterprise. Nevertheless, the Morristown plant was
still conducting a very respectable business at this time and was
to continue for some four decades longer. The Comstock enterprise
never seemed to have been much embarrassed by the muckraking
attacks that surrounded the passage of the Federal Food and Drug
Act of 1906. Aside from the enforcement of these measures by the
energetic Harvey Wiley, the two most effective private assaults
upon the patent-medicine trade probably were the exposures by
Samuel Hopkins Adams in a series of articles in <i>Collier's</i>
magazine in 1905-1906, under the title, "The Great American
Fraud," and the two volumes entitled, <i>Nostrums and
Quackery</i>, embodying reprints of numerous articles in the
<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> over a period
of years. Both sources named names fearlessly and described
consequences bluntly. But the Comstock remedies, either because
they may have been deemed harmless, or because the company's
location in a small village in a remote corner of the country
enabled it to escape unfriendly attention, seemed to have enjoyed
relative immunity from these attacks. At least, none of the
Comstock remedies was mentioned by name.[13] To be sure, these
preparations&mdash;or at least those destined for consumption
within the United States&mdash;had to comply with the new drug
laws, to publish their ingredients, and over a period of time to
reduce sharply the extensive list of conditions which they were
supposed to cure. Nevertheless, it seems probable that the
general change in public attitudes rather than any direct
consequences of legislative enforcement caused the eventual
demise of the Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills.<br>

Foreign business began to assume considerable importance after
1900; shipments from Morristown to the West Indies and Latin
America were heavy, and the company also listed branches (perhaps
no more than warehouses or agencies) in London, Hongkong, and
Sydney, Australia. Certain of the order books picked up out of
the litter on the floor of the abandoned factory give a
suggestion of sales volume since 1900:<br>
<br>

<pre>

                    gross             Estimated

1910      5,975      &mdash;&mdash;       &mdash;&mdash;        96,000
1920      3,243      &mdash;&mdash;       &mdash;&mdash;        52,000
1930        &mdash;&mdash;     1,893      &mdash;&mdash;        30,000
1941        316      &mdash;&mdash;       &mdash;&mdash;         5,000
</pre>
The foregoing data show sales of the Indian Root Pills only; this
was by far the most important product, but the factory was also
selling Worm Pellets, Judson's Pills (up to 1920), and N &amp; B
Liniment. Also, this tabulation excludes sales in quantities less
than one gross, and there were actually many such smaller orders.
Only physical shipments were shown in the records recovered, and
the dollar volume is the author's computation at $16 per gross,
the price which prevailed for many years. Through 1900 there was
only a single order book; beginning prior to 1910, separate
domestic and foreign order books were introduced, but most of
them have been lost. On the assumption that there was a fair
volume of foreign sales in 1910, total sales must have continued
to climb through the decade then ending, but by 1920 domestic
sales&mdash;and probably total sales&mdash;had dropped
materially. The number of employees, apparently about forty at
the peak of the business, had dropped to thirteen according to
the 1915 paybook but recovered slightly to sixteen in 1922. These
fragmentary data suggest that the Morristown branch of the
Comstock enterprise probably never grossed much over $100,000,
but in an era when $12 or $15 represented a good weekly wage and
the clutching grasp of the income-tax collector was still
unknown, this was more than adequate to support the proprietor in
comfort and to number him among the more influential citizens of
the district. It is not known how Morristown sales compared with
those of the Brockville factory, but it may be assumed that the
company utilized its "dual nationality" to the utmost advantage,
to benefit from favorable tariff laws and minimize the
restrictions of both countries. The Morristown plant supplied the
lucrative Latin American trade, while during the era of Imperial
preference, Brockville must have handled the English, Oriental,
and Australian business.<br>

For many decades&mdash;from 1900 at least up into the
1930s&mdash;a number of very large shipments, normally 100 gross
or more in single orders, were made to Gilpin, Langdon &amp; Co.,
Baltimore, and to Columbia Warehouse Co. in St. Louis, important
regional distributors.<br>
<br>
Many substantial orders were also received from legitimate drug
houses, such as Lehn &amp; Fink; Schieffelin &amp; Co.; Smith,
Kline &amp; French; and McKesson &amp; Robbins. Curiously, A.J.
White &amp; Co. of New York City also appears in the order book,
around 1900, as an occasional purchaser. Among the foreign orders
received in 1930 the United Fruit Company was, by a wide margin,
the largest single customer.<br>
<br>
Pills destined for the Latin American market were packaged
alternatively in "glass" or "tin," and were also labeled
"Spanish" or "English," as the purchasers might direct. Spanish
language almanacs and other advertising matter were generally
inserted in the foreign parcels, along with many copies of
"tapes"&mdash;the advertisements of the worm pills conspicuously
illustrated with a horrifying picture of an enormous
tapeworm.<br>
<br>
Sales volume began to decline more precipitously in the 1930s,
and the Morristown factory was no longer working even close to
capacity. The domestic order book for 1941 shows sales of the
Indian Root Pills, in quantities of one gross or more, of only
316 gross. The Royal Drug Co. of Chicago gave one single order
for 44 gross, and Myers Bros. Drug Co. of St. Louis bought 25
gross in one shot, but otherwise orders in excess of five gross
were rare, and those for one gross alone&mdash;or for one half
gross, one fourth gross, or one sixth gross&mdash;were far more
common. The number of orders was still substantial, and the
packing and mailing clerks must have been kept fairly busy, but
they were working hard for a sharply reduced total volume. Some
stimulus was provided for the factory during the war years by a
military contract for foot powder, but the decline became even
more precipitous after the conflict. The Comstock Hotel was
destroyed by fire in 1925, never to be rebuilt. And by the late
1940s the once-busy railroad bisecting the factory
property&mdash;the old Utica &amp; Black River&mdash;had
deteriorated to one lonely train crawling over its track in each
direction, on weekdays only, but still carrying a New York City
sleeping car. The 1950 order book reveals a business that had
withered away to almost nothing. Once again, as in 1900, both
foreign and domestic sales were recorded in a single book, but
now foreign sales greatly outstripped the domestic. In fact, a
mere 18 gross of the pills were sold&mdash;in quantities of one
gross or more&mdash;in the domestic market in that year,
contrasting sadly with nearly 6,000 gross in 1910. Even the Henry
P. Gilpin Co. of Baltimore, which at one time had been ordering
100 gross or more every month or six weeks, took only a meager
four gross during the entire year. There were a large number of
very small shipments&mdash;such as four boxes of pills here, or a
bottle of liniment there&mdash;but these did not aggregate very
much and gave the appearance of merely accommodating individual
customers who could no longer find their favorite remedies in
their own local drug stores.<br>
<br>
The foreign business&mdash;chiefly in the West Indies, Puerto
Rico, and South America&mdash;was still fairly substantial in
1950, amounting to 579 gross of the Indian Root Pills, but this
was far from compensating for the virtual disappearance of the
domestic market. At the old price of $16 per gross&mdash;which
may no longer have been correct in 1950&mdash;the Morristown
factory could not have taken in a great deal more than
$10,000&mdash;hardly enough to justify its continued operation.
In any case, it was obviously only the foreign business that kept
the plant operating as long as it did; without that it would
probably have closed its doors 20 years earlier.<br>
<br>
A number of customers were, however, faithful to the Comstock
Company for very many years. Schieffelin &amp; Co. and McKesson
&amp; Robbins were both important customers way back in the
1840s, and their favor had been an object of dispute in the split
between Lucius and the other brothers in 1851. Schieffelin still
appeared frequently in the order books up to the 1920s; during
the final years McKesson &amp; Robbins was by far the largest
single domestic customer. A number of other firms&mdash;John L.
Thompson Sons &amp; Co. of Troy, N.Y.; T. Sisson &amp; Co. of
Hartford, Conn.; and Gilman Brothers of Boston,
Mass.&mdash;appear both in the 1896 and the 1950 order books,
although unfortunately the quantities taken had fallen from one
or two gross at a shot in the earlier year to a mere quarter
gross or a few dozen boxes by 1950.<br>
<br>
Toward the end, in the late 1950s, employment in the factory
dropped to only three persons&mdash;J.M. Barney (foreman),
Charles Pitcher, and Florence Cree&mdash;and they were only doing
maintenance work and filling such few orders, mostly in
quantities of a few dozen boxes only, that came to the factory
unsolicited. Gone were the days of travelers scouring the back
country, visiting country druggists, and pushing the pills, while
simultaneously disparaging rival or "counterfeit" concoctions;
gone were the days when the almanacs and other advertising
circulars poured out of Morristown in the millions of copies;
long since vanished were the sweeping claims of marvelous cures
for every conceivable ailment. In these final days the Indian
Root Pills, now packaged in a flat metal box with a sliding lid,
were described modestly as the Handy Vegetable Laxative. And the
ingredients were now printed on the box; nothing more was heard
of Dr. Morse's remarkable discovery gleaned during his long
sojourn with the Indians of the western plains.<br>

Although the records disclose nothing to this effect, it is a
fair premise that the Comstock family often must have considered
closing the Morristown plant after World War II and, more
particularly, in the decade of the 1950s. Such inclinations may,
however, have been countered by a willingness to let the plant
run as long as a trickle of business continued and it did not
fall too far short of covering expenses. The last few surviving
employees were very elderly, and their jobs may have been
regarded as a partial substitute for pensions. This view is
evidenced by an injury report for George Clute, who suffered a
fit of coughing while mixing pills in January 1941; he was then
77 years old and had been working in the factory for 34 years.
The final paybooks show deductions for Social Security and
unemployment insurance&mdash;specimens of vexatious red tape that
the factory had avoided for most of its existence.<br>
<br>
The decision to close the Morristown factory was finally forced
upon the family, on May 15, 1959, by the death of William Henry
Comstock II&mdash;"Young Bill"&mdash;who had been president of
the company since 1921. Like his father, "Young Bill" Comstock
had been a prominent citizen of Brockville for many years, served
a term as mayor&mdash;although he was defeated in a contest for a
parliamentary seat&mdash;was also active in civic and social
organizations, and achieved recognition as a sportsman and
speedboat operator.<br>

The actual end of the business came in the spring of 1960. The
frequency and size of orders had dropped sharply, although the
names of many of the old customers still appeared, as well as
individuals who would send one dollar for three boxes of the
pills. These small shipments were usually mailed, rather than
going by express or freight, as formerly. The very last two
shipments, appropriately, were to old customers: One package of
one-dozen boxes of pills on March 31, 1960, to Gilman Brothers of
Boston, and two-dozen boxes to McKesson &amp; Robbins at Mobile,
Alabama, on April 11. And with this final consignment the factory
closed its doors, concluding ninety-three years of continuous
operation in the riverside village of Morristown.<br>
<br>
Very little of this story remains to be told. Mrs. Comstock
became president of the company during its liquidation&mdash;and
thus was a successor to her <i>father-in-law</i>, who had first
entered the business as a clerk, <i>119 years earlier</i>, in
1841. The good will of the company and a few assets were sold to
the Milburn Company of Scarborough, Ontario, but the Comstock
business was terminated, and the long career of Dr. Morse's
Indian Root Pills brought to a close. The few superannuated
employees were assured of protection against all medical
expenses, by the company or by the Comstock family, for the rest
of their lives. A few years later the associated Canadian factory
standing in the heart of Brockville was torn down; during its
lifetime that community had grown up around it, from a village to
a flourishing small city. The buildings in Morristown were sold
to other parties and left to stand untenanted and forlorn for
years. The upper (packaging) building, from which the records
were recovered, remains in fair condition and may yet be
renovated for some further use. The lower (pill-mixing) building,
after standing derelict and at the point of collapse for many
years, was finally torn down in 1971. The hotel, a large water
tank behind the factory, and the combination depot and customs
house have all vanished from the scene. The shed where the
Comstocks kept their yacht has been maintained and still shelters
several boats, but the ferry slip just below the factory steps is
now abandoned, and no longer do vessels ply back and forth across
the river to connect Morristown and Brockville. The railroad only
survived the passing of the factory by a year or two and is now
memorialized by no more than a line of decaying ties. The main
highway leading westward from Ogdensburg toward the Thousand
Islands area has been straightened and rerouted to avoid
Morristown, so that now only the straying or misguided traveler
will enter the village. If he does enter he will find a pleasant
community, scenically located on a small bay of the St. Lawrence
River, commanding an enticing view of the Canadian shore, and
rising in several stages above the lower level, where the factory
once stood; but it is a somnolent village. No longer do river
packet steamers call at the sagging pier, no longer do trains
thread their way between the factory buildings and chug to a halt
at the adjacent station. No longer do hope-giving pills and
elixirs, or almanacs and circulars in the millions, pour out of
Morristown destined for country drugstores and lonely farmhouses
over half a continent. Only memories persist around the empty
ferry slip, the vanished railroad station, and the abandoned
factory buildings&mdash;for so many years the home of the
distinguished Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills.<br>

Although the original Comstock enterprise has been dissolved
and<br>

been<br>
 related herein, Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and Comstock's
Worm<br>
 Tablets are still being manufactured and sold&mdash;by the W.H.

 Company Pty. Ltd., in Australia. This concern, originally a<br>
 subsidiary of the Canadian company, is headed by the former

 and the Orient following the dissolution of the Brockville
company.<br>
 Distribution is also carried out from this source into New

 the pills being described as "The Overnight Laxative with the
Tonic<br>
 Action," but a reproduction of the old label and the
facsimile<br>

 portrayed. Thus, the Indian Root Pills have been
manufactured<br>
 continuously for at least 115 years and the Comstock

nearly<br>
 140 years.<br>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
